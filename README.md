## Future Scaper

Future Scaper uses the USDA database to help our users form better and more precise landscaping projects.
There are over 40,000 different plants to choose from. Once you have a good idea as to what you want to work with, hope on over to the Planner. From there, you'll be able to choose, drag and drop different plants. This should be able to help you better plan the layout of your landscaping project.

## Motivation

We wanted to create an application that would help amateur gardeners plan out their ideas/dreams. Not many people know about the distances you're to plant other plants from one another as well as the amount one should water but not the other. Our aim is to simplify this.
